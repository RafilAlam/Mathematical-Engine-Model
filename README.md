# 🧮 CLI Engine Simulator  
🔧 **A Physics-Based Engine RPM Simulator in Your Terminal**  
> A minimalist yet powerful **engine model simulator** built entirely in **Python**. This project uses custom physics calculations to simulate real-time RPM behavior based on throttle input, torque curve, and friction — all rendered live in the terminal. A hands-on demonstration of how mechanical principles like torque and inertia come to life through code.
